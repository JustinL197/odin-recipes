    <h2>Cheesy Alfredo Pasta</h2>
    <p>A cheesy Alfredo pasta is a classic and indulgent Italian dish known for its rich and creamy sauce. 
        The sauce is made with butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, creating a luscious and velvety texture. 
        Often seasoned with garlic and black pepper, the sauce is then tossed with cooked fettuccine pasta, creating a deliciously cheesy and comforting dish. 
        It's a popular choice for pasta lovers who enjoy a decadent and satisfying meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta  </li>

        <li>1 ¼ cups butter, divided</li>

        <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>

        <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese</li> 

        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed, divided</li>

        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>

        <li>8 ounces diced mushrooms</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package frozen shrimp, deveined and tails removed, thawed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over medium heat. Stir in fettuccine, return to a boil, and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and keep warm. </li>
            
        <li>While the fettuccine is cooking, heat 1 cup butter and cream in a large saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add Romano, Parmesan, 1/3 of the garlic, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until cheese melts and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            
        <li>At the same time, heat remaining 1/4 cup butter and olive oil in another saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms and remaining garlic; increase the heat to medium-high and cook until mushrooms are soft, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and cook until bright pink on the outside and opaque in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Fold shrimp mixture into sauce. Add drained fettuccine and toss to coat. </li>
    </ol>
