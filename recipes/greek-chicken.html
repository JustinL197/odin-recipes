    <h2>Greek Chicken</h2>
    <p>Greek chicken is a flavorful and aromatic dish inspired by Mediterranean cuisine. Typically, it involves marinating chicken pieces with a blend of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and other Greek herbs and spices. The marinated chicken is then roasted or grilled to perfection, resulting in a tender and juicy texture with a delightful combination of citrusy, herby, and savory flavors. It's a delicious and wholesome dish that reflects the vibrant and robust tastes of Greek cooking. Serve it with traditional accompaniments like tzatziki sauce, pita bread, or a Greek salad for a complete and satisfying meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup olive oil</li>

        <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>

        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>

        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and oregano in a glass dish. Place chicken pieces in the mixture; cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>

        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Place chicken on the grill, and discard the marinade. Cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes per side (smaller pieces will not take as long). An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
